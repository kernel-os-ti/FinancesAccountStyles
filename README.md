# Account Styles for Finances App

A community-driven collection of account style definitions (logo, color, etc.) for use in the [Finances iOS App](https://github.com/yourrepo/finances) and similar finance-related projects. This repository enables apps to provide bank-specific visual customization, enhancing user experience with branded account icons and color themes.

## Why?

We do _not_ own or claim ownership of bank logos or trademarks contained in this repository. By making this collection open-source and community-maintained:

- Banks and financial institutions can submit modifications or removals of their own styles/logos.

- App developers can more easily integrate up-to-date, accurate bank branding in a responsible way.

## Contribution Guidelines
